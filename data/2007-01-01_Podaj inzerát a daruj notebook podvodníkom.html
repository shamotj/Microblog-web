<p>Minulý týždeň som podal rovnaký inzerát na 2 slovenské inzertné portály. Na moje prekvapenie som do 5 minút dostal prvú odpoveď, od angličana.</p>
<p>Jeho mail bol jasný, chce kúpiť môj notebook pre svojho synovca ktorý je na štúdiu v Nigérií. Osobne ma samozrejme vôbec nezaujíma pre koho môj notebook kupujúci chce a myslím si že v našich končinách nie je zvyklé predávajúcemu vysvetlovať ako chceme s ponúkaným tovarom naložiť. Ešte väčšmi ma však zauajal údajný pôvod záujemcu. Prečo by akýkoľvek angličan kupoval používaný notebook zo Slovenska? A k tomu ešte preto aby ho následne poslal do Nigérie.</p>
<p>V hlave sa mi vynorilo príliš veľa otázok a nenachádzal som iné logické vysvetlenie ako to, že ide o podvod. Napriek tomu som však z čistého záujmu pokračoval a snažil som sa pôsobiť prirodzene. Prikladám celú mailovú komunikáciu so záujemcom (samozrejme som z pochopiteľných dôvôdov cenzúroval svoje údaje).</p>

Hi,

I am willing to sell my notebook, however shipping cost to Nigeria from 
Slovakia is far too expensive, in fact it would be even more than 
notebook itself. I suggest you to look at some Nigerian's local stores.

Good,
Just want to confirm if you will be around by 9-10 am tomorrow because i will schedule the
 pickup tomorrow morning when i finish making the payment in the bank.
I just called my bank manager to know you have giving me the full needed info.
Hope to hear from you soon. </pre>
<p><strong>Ja:</strong></p>
<pre>
Yes, I will be available tomorrow morning, however, I will give the 
notebook to FedEx guy only in case I will be notiefied from my bank that 
I've recived money. I am affraid that  trans-national money transfer takes more than 1 day. </pre>
<p><strong>On:</strong></p>
<pre>
Hello,
The bank will contact you immediately they confirm the payment tomorrow
 morning.You will be notify.I will be in the bank very early and make the 
payment so by 10 am the fedex man will come for the package.You must
 have receive a confirmation of the payment made.
  So i think there is no problem.
I hope you understand this well.
Micheal </pre>
<p><strong>Ja:</strong></p>
<pre>
I will trust only my bank, so once I recieve notification from them,
 I am ready to send package. Confirmation from other bank (or person) is irrelevant to me.
 I belive you understand my attitude.
Regards </pre>
<p><strong>On:</strong></p>
<pre>
Well i understand you and one more thing i wnt you to know is that this is a
 international transaction in which the transfer will take up to 24-48 hours.But
 ones it is done the bank will notify you money is in process in to your account. </pre>
<p><strong>Ja - finále:</strong></p>
<pre>
International transactions are not processed the way you described it, and you will
 receive no notification from your bank until they receive money from the sender's bank.
 I must also say that your order is highly suspicious since beginning. Self called
 British (with bad grammar) is ordering notebook from Slovakia (without any
 knowledge of language), while he has a lot of better offers in Britain. You asked me 
for specifications, but they were already in advertisement. You did not care about 
price at all and you didn't notice me that I forget to write it for you. I believe that
I won't receive any money, I also believe that there is some organized group with simple 
interest in getting goods without paying and that you rely on naivity of victims. 
Just a few minutes ago I received email from another British guy, who is willing to buy 
my notebook, but this time for his son. This is quite ludicrous. You should know that
 I will alert my friends and other people who are advertising on Slovak portals 
and I am also considering about notifying local authorities.

PS: Consider my offer as canceled.

<p><strong>Dnes som dostal mail z údajnej banky Citi Bank, ktorá mala svojím názvom pripomínať existujúcu Citibank.</strong> Správa bola v HTML formáte a aby sa zachovala čo najvernejšia podoba, nevložil som ju priamo sem ale nájdete ju <a href="http://toocube.neonus.sk/pages/static/citibank.html">tu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Chvíľu potom mi prišiel ďaľší mail od záujemcu. Zjavne plne ignoroval môj posledný mail a vôbec naň nereagoval.</strong></p>
<pre>
Hello,
     I just came back from the bank and i tried to schedule the pick up,I was told it cant
 be made here.So here below is the Fedex Account Number(393186763) in which
 you will just go to the fedex outlet and drop the package without paying any money.You
 will fill the waybill and bill the shipping to the account .Hope you understand my concern.
I hope to do more business with you.
Regards
Micheal Raymond </pre>

<p>Myslím že ide o ukážkový podvod, bohužiaľ existuje asi množstvo ľudí ktorý sa nechajú nachytať. Tak naozaj neviem koho by som mal na túto aktivitu upozorniť, k žiadnemu zločinu totiž nedošlo, azda len porušenie nejakých copyrightov Citibanku. Ak máte nápad koho by som mal upozorniť alebo kontaktovať, prosím dajte mi vedieť na môj mail.</p>
